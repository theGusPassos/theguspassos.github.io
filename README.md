# Gustavo Passos' Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website developed with React and served as a [github page](https://theguspassos.github.io/#/)

![My personal portfolio](demo/desktop-and-mobile-page.png)

The process of building a react application and serving it as a github page is well explained [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

The website's design is fully responsive and was made scratch by me. I used [figma](https://www.figma.com/) to prototype the mobile and desktop pages and created the styling with styled-componets without any other css framework.

If you desire to use the same design for your own portfolio feel free to do it, just make sure to give me the credit for the structure in some way =)
